A *deterministic random number* generator for node.    
This module has some important advantages over other modules:

- Only **400 bytes** in size (without gzip)!
- **O(1)** complexity
- **100%** test coverage

## Supported algorithms
* [Fair Dice Roll](https://www.xkcd.com/221/)
* [Dilbert Oracle](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305130209/https://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25)

## Installation

```bash
npm i --save @<deadname>/random.js
```

## Usage
```js
const { fairDiceRoll, dilbertOracle } = require('@<deadname>/random.js')
console.log(fairDiceRoll())
console.log(dilbertOracle())
```

## Roadmap
This project has a very ambitious roadmap
for discovering and implementing new algorithms.

We are working hard to ship new algorithm by these dates.
Note that these dates are estimates and are thus subject to change.

* Q2 2040: Implement 2 new algorithms.
* Q4 2050: Implement 5 additional algorithms.
* Q1 2060: Rewrite this project in Rust.
* Q3 2070: Delete both the project and its rewrite.
